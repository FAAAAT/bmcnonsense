- ASpeed 2400 BMC - That's good already supported by openbmc/u-boot
- flashrom needs a patch for this flash chip: https://review.coreboot.org/#/c/19855/
- ISP seems to work fine - no soldering required :)
- No identifiable debug serial port on the board - suspicious arrangement
  of pins near COM1, but no signal discernable.
- Well, since the AST2400 is supported, maybe just try flashing u-boot
  and see what happens.
- Not much luck. BMC ethernet port leds do light up with cable plugged in,
  but no signals.
- Also tried flashing full OpenBMC distro - same behavior
- An early serial port would be nice :|
